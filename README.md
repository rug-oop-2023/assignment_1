The assignment is divided into 4 blocks.
Block 1, 2, and 3 all define different classes.

Put the three classes in three separate files in the `src` folder, with the names specified in the PDF.
**Leave the __init__.py file untouched**.

Put the **main.py** script **outside** of the `src` folder, in the root of this repo.

Below this line, you can write your report to motivate your design choices.
